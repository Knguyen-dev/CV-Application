# CV-Application
-   Designs for inspiration:

- Issues:

1. Added job form, but an issue is that we seem to be mutating 
    the exampleResumeData's arrays (jobList and schoolList) in 
    our application
5. Account for responsive design
5. Try to do those smooth drop downs. It'll probably involve us
    having to mess with the height using a class.
6. Make sure the closing and opening of forms doesn't affect the 
    resume's size
