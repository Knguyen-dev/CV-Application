- Issues:

5. Improve the styling and account for responsive design

7. Try to do those smooth drop downs. It'll probably involve us
    having to mess with the height using a class.


6. Try to do the download resume functionality

8. Make sure the closing and opening of forms doesn't affect the 
    resume's size
9. Try to do customization section
