# CV-Application
-   Designs for inspiration:

- Issues:

1. Maybe need to make an array in App to define the 
    key-words for the forms. That or use state updater, which will
    allow us to use the previous state.

2. Need to work on deleting. Make it flexible for foresight.
3. add a form for professional experiences and have the application
    accomodate that.

5. Account for responsive design
5. Try to do those smooth drop downs. It'll probably involve us
    having to mess with the height using a class.
6. Make sure the closing and opening of forms doesn't affect the 
    resume's size
